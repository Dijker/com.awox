Adjust the RGB color, brightness, set your preferred white temperature and unlock the full potential of your devices through AwoX app on Homey

The app is a Community initiative.
To request additional devices, please use Athom Homey Community Forum.

At this moment only Zigbee is supported for the devices, no Bluetooth.

Note:
Until FirmWare 2.3.9, AwoX used one common Zigbee ProductID for multiple types of devices (Dim, Tunable, RGB, E27, GU10, LEDpannels, etc.)
As of Firmware 2.3.12, AwoX is giving different products their own Zigbee ProductID.
Advice: First update the Firmware via the Mobile AwoX App via Bluetooth, otherwise this will cause problems later.
See community forum for the added productIDs
